<p class="uk-text-lead">
I’m a passionate software engineer who loves hacking and collaborating at the intersection of several disciplines. 
My area of expertise overlaps with location-aware computing, distributed systems, databases, data structures, network protocols and information security. 
</p>

<p>
I recently completed a PhD in Information Systems at the University of Lausanne, where my research resulted in a thesis entitled <i>"Three Temporal Perspectives on Decentralized Location-aware Computing: Past, Present, Future"</i>.
In parallel to that, I co-founded <a href="https://www.astrocast.com/" alt="Astrocast SA">Astrocast</a>, a fast growing startup active in the Internet of Things.
Prior to that, I worked for several years in startups and as a freelance, successfully completing numberous projects in public transportion and watch making companies.
</p>

<p>
Early in my career, I have been exposed to extreme programming (XP) and open source development, which taught me the importance of test automation, build reproducibility and continuous integration.
I believe these practices greatly contribute at establishing a productive development environment.
I often experienced first hand the ups and downs of being (too?) curious, but I’m not getting tired of learning yet!
