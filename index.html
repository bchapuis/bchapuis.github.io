<p class="uk-text-lead">
I’m a passionate software engineer and researcher who loves hacking and collaborating at the intersection of several disciplines. 
My area of expertise overlaps with location-aware computing, distributed systems, databases, data structures, network protocols and information security. 
</p>

<p>
I'm currently working as an associate professor at <a href="https://heig-vd.ch" alt="Heig-vd">Heig-vd</a>.
Previously, I worked as a research scientist in the <a href="https://people.unil.ch/kevinhuguenin/">Information Security and Privacy Lab</a> of the University of Lausanne.
Prior to that, I completed a PhD in Information Systems, where my research resulted in a thesis entitled <a href="/pubs/2018-Thesis.pdf" class="uk-link-text uk-icon-link" uk-icon="file-pdf" style="display: inline" target="_blank"><i>"Three Temporal Perspectives on Decentralized Location-aware Computing: Past, Present, Future"</i> </a>.
I also worked for several years in <a href="https://www.astrocast.com/" alt="Astrocast SA">statups</a> and as a freelance, successfully completing numerous projects in geospatial, public transportion and watch making companies.
</p>

<p>
Early in my career, I have been exposed to extreme programming (XP) and open source development, which taught me the importance of test automation, build reproducibility and continuous integration.
I believe these practices greatly contribute at establishing a productive development environment.
I often experienced first hand the ups and downs of being (too?) curious, but I’m not getting tired of learning yet!
